                        <h2>Background</h2>
                        <p>Researchers in the medical field often have little experience in UI and UX design. Often
                            times, this leads to underdeveloped front ends for web apps connected to research papers.
                            This in turn can lead to lower understanding of the reserach material by others, and can
                            hinder the progress of collaborative research. By
                            creating an easy to use frontend framework, researchers will be able to plug in their
                            already made functions into an aesthetically pleasing template with minimal effort, allowing
                            them to focus on their own work.

                        <h2>Development</h2>
                        <p>I decided to focus heavily on the ease of transition between local functions to server hosted
                            web apps. By using Shiny, R programs can be converted into a UI/request based application,
                            though the UI needs to be developed further. By implementing Shiny functions into the
                            framework, need for redundant documentation was reduced, and by preimplementing as many of
                            the "basics" of web apps as possible, the framework can quickly be used without need for
                            consideration of the more complex, but common, intricacies of online hosted applications.
                            Furthermore, easy access to commonly changed variables (such as colors) was heavily
                            considered, and were made easy to access when using the framework. </p>

                        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                        <p>With this framework, researchers can quickly develop applications without the need to
                            consider the frontend while they conduct resaerch. Presets are a good way to increase
                            usability of frameworks that may be too complicated otherwise.</p>
