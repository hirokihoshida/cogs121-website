                        <h2>Background </h2>
                        <p>Many people often struggle with time management, especially in balancing their workload with
                            breaks. In particular, people who need to adapt to a more rigorous schedule (high
                            school/college freshmen, etc.)
                            need to develop good work habits quickly or they will cement bad habits that become
                            increasingly harder to shake off as time goes on. Many students are never taught proper time
                            management techniques, and have to go off their
                            own experiences.

                            A webapp that creates a strict work/break micro schedule based on the user’s overall
                            schedule can be helpful in developing these habits.

                        <h2>Research</h2>
                        <p>First, I needed to observe how people studied in the first place. I observed multiple
                            peoples’ study habits, such as how they rationed out their breaks (long breaks between each
                            task, short breaks during tasks, etc.), and surveyed how productive they felt after
                            different kinds of studying methods. Second, I researched various time management
                            techniques, and
                            tried various methods to see which felt most effective, and how they can be improved.

                        <h2>Development</h2>
                        <p>The main focus was ease of integration into already existing schedules. There was no need to
                            rebuild an entire schedule/calendar app, but just the need for a schedule micromanager.
                            I decided that users should Input tasks already decided on earlier, then FocusNow can then
                            automatically section them off into small
                            pieces. Another focus was the ease of understanding the usage of the app as quickly as
                            possible. In order to do this, FocusNow automatically does functions such as splitting tasks
                            as soon as user inputs them,
                            and sets default values (that user can change) that allows for optimal use.

                        <p>Early focus on study habits were important
                        <ul>
                            <li>Don’t try to reshape habits entirely, allow for integration and a more subtle adaptation
                                for users</li>
                        </ul>
                        Cut down on unnecessary features
                        <ul>
                            <li>Most people already have a calendar app of their choice, don’t try to force users to
                                replace items in their routine if you want to introduce something new.</li>
